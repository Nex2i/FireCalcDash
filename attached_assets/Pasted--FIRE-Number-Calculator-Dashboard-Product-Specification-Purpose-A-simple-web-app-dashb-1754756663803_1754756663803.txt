## FIRE Number Calculator Dashboard – Product Specification

### **Purpose**

A simple web app dashboard to help users determine the earliest age they can retire based on the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) methodology. It calculates the retirement “FIRE number” in both real (today’s dollars) and nominal terms, then finds the age when investments meet or exceed the nominal target.

### **Calculation Rules**

1. **Compounding** – Annual compounding on contributions and existing investments.
2. **Windfalls** – Added at the start of the year in which they occur.
3. **Inflation Adjustment** – Nominal FIRE number = Real FIRE number × `(1 + inflation rate) ^ years until retirement`.
4. **Crossover Point** – Find the first year where `total investments >= nominal FIRE number`.
5. **Rounding** – Output values rounded to nearest \$1,000; ages rounded to nearest year.

### **Example Scenario**

* Real expenses: \$200k/year
* Real FIRE number: \$5M (`200k / 0.04`)
* Achieved in 20 years, inflation 3% → Nominal FIRE number: \$9.03M.
* Investment growth curve shows crossing \$9.03M at age 55 → user can retire then.
